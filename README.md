# An As-Yet Untitled Roguelike
I cannot spell :/

# Video 1 - Player Movement
Implemented cell-by-cell movement. This took a little long (~1hr) because I wanted to implement a message queue system. This will help in the long run and was required for later on. Features implemented in this video:

- Player input using the cursor keys
- Animated movement of the player's sprite from one cell to another in the cardinal directions (North, South, East and West)
- Message queue to send messages, events and commands
